This is a web app used to display a) ontario's vaccination progress and b) the active cases in Ontario by health unit. 

This app was created using next.js framework and chart.js library. Runs node.js in background, utilizing vercel's serverless functions. 

There is a linear trendline fit to the vaccination chart which is colour-coded to line up with ontario's reopening strategy. 

This is just for my own personal information and not meant for commercial licencing or any important use-cases.
